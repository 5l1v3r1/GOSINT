# Contributing

Contribution to this project is highly encouraged!  GOSINT uses the BSD license. To contribute to this project, you must certify that you have the rights to license your contribution for use in GOSINT under the BSD license and that it is not subject to any other licenses.
 
To help ensure that these criteria are met, GOSINT requires that you follow the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process. The DCO is an attestation attached to each contribution made by every developer, which you can find below or at http://developercertificate.org/. In the commit message for each commit in the pull request, the developer simply adds a sign-off statement agreeing to the DCO, e.g., â€œSigned-off-by: Andrew Wiggin <ender@eros.io>" with the DCO text manually added to your commit body.
