Welcome to GOSINT's documentation!
==================================

The GOSINT framework is a project used for collecting, processing, and exporting high quality indicators of compromise (IOCs).

GOSINT allows a security analyst to collect and standardize structured and unstructured threat intelligence.

Applying threat intelligence to security operations enriches alert data with additional confidence, context, and co-occurrence. This means that you apply research from third parties to security event data to identify similar, or identical, indicators of malicious behavior. The framework is written in Go with a JavaScript frontend.
